# Timed Quiz — Advanced Challenge (Scaffold Only)

## Goal
Create a 10-question quiz from an **array of objects**. Show one question at a time with 3–4 choices, run a countdown timer, and score correct answers.

## Core Requirements
- Use data like:
  ```js
  var questions = [
    { q: 'What does DOM stand for?', choices: ['Data Object Map','Document Object Model','Document Oriented Markup'], answer: 1 },
    { q: 'Strict equality operator?', choices: ['==','===','!='], answer: 1 }
  ];
  ```
- 10 questions total. 1 point per correct answer.
- 60-second timer. When time hits 0 or last question answered → show score.
- Buttons for choices. On click, move to the next question.
- **Stretch:** Save high score to `localStorage`.

## Submission
- Repo URL + GitHub Pages URL.
