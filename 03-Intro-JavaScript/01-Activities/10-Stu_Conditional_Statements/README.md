# 🏗️ Build a System Status Checker Using Conditional Statements

Work with a partner to complete this activity and explore how conditional statements control logic flow in JavaScript.

## 👤 User Story

> **As a developer,**  
> I want to create an algorithm that checks two system conditions,  
> so that I can output different results depending on which conditions are true.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- **It’s done when** `"True ✅ True ✅"` logs to the console when both conditions are true.  
- **It’s done when** `"True ✅ False ❌"` logs when only the first condition is true.  
- **It’s done when** `"False ❌ True ✅"` logs when only the second condition is true.  
- **It’s done when** `"False ❌ False ❌"` logs when neither condition is true.

## 🧱 Your Task

1. Create a new file named **`script.js`** and copy the starter code below:

   ```js
   // 🖥️ System Status Checker
   // Change the values and operators below to test different outcomes

   const systemLoad = 50;
   const isUserPresent = true;
   const isSystemOverloaded = (systemLoad > 75);

   // 🧠 Your Task: Write conditional statements that evaluate combinations of true/false
