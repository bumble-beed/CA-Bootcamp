# 🍔 Object Practice — Food Order Tracker (20-Stu_Objects)

Work with a partner to create and interact with a JavaScript **object** that represents a customer’s food order.  
You’ll practice defining objects, accessing their data, and using both **dot** and **bracket** notation.

## 👤 User Story

> **As a JavaScript learner,**  
> I want to store multiple related pieces of data in an object,  
> so that I can easily access and display them later in my code.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- **It’s done when** I create an object that represents a food or drink order with **at least three properties**.  
- **It’s done when** I log the entire object to the console.  
- **It’s done when** I check the value of one property (e.g., `isReady`) in a conditional statement.  
- **It’s done when** I display a message using both **dot** and **bracket** notation to access properties.

## 🧱 Your Task

1. Create a file named **`script.js`**.  
2. Inside it, create an object named **`order`** with at least three properties:
   - One **string** property (e.g., `"item": "Latte"` or `"item": "Sushi Roll"`)  
   - One **array** or **number** property (e.g., `"extras": ["Soy Milk", "Whipped Cream"]` or `"quantity": 2`)  
   - One **boolean** property (e.g., `"isReady": true`)  
3. Log the entire object to the console.  
4. Write an **if/else** statement that:
   - Uses **dot notation** in the `if` block to display a message if the order *is ready*  
   - Uses **bracket notation** in the `else` block to display a message if the order *is not ready*  
5. Make sure your message references the object’s property values.
