// WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
// ðŸŽµ Music Playlist Example
// So far, we've been storing a single piece of data in each variable.
const songTitle = "Midnight Sky";
const songDuration = 3.45;
const isFavorite = true;

// ðŸ§± To store multiple values together, we can use an array.
const playlist = ["Midnight Sky", "Neon Lights", "Golden Hour", "Waves"];

// ðŸ§¾ Logging the entire array
console.log(playlist); // ["Midnight Sky", "Neon Lights", "Golden Hour", "Waves"]

// ðŸŽ¯ Accessing a single value by index (arrays are zero-indexed)
console.log(playlist[1]); // "Neon Lights"
console.log(playlist[0]); // "Midnight Sky"

// ðŸ”„ Using an index to update a value
console.log(playlist[3]); // "Waves"

// Replace the fourth song with a new track
playlist[3] = "Electric Heart";

// Logs "The fourth song is Electric Heart."
console.log(`The fourth song is ${playlist[3]}.`);

// ðŸ§® Using the array's length property to get how many songs are in the playlist
console.log(`The playlist has ${playlist.length} songs.`);
