# 🏀 Team Roster Arrays — Working with Lists of Data

Work with a partner to complete this activity and learn how to store and access multiple pieces of related data using **arrays** in JavaScript.

---

## 👤 User Story

> **As a new JavaScript developer,**  
> I want to create and manipulate arrays,  
> so that I can store and access groups of related information efficiently.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- **It’s done when** I create an array that stores at least **four values**.  
- **It’s done when** I can **log the entire array** to the console.  
- **It’s done when** I can **access individual elements** by their index.  
- **It’s done when** I can **replace** a value in the array and verify the change with a log statement.  
- **It’s done when** I use the array’s **`.length`** property to display how many elements it contains.

## 🧱 Your Task

You will be working with arrays to represent a **team roster** (or your own creative theme).  

1. Now, create your own array representing something else — such as:
   - A list of **favorite movies**
   - A group of **coding languages**
   - A **shopping list**
   - A **travel destination wish list**
   - Or even **pets or friends**

2. Log the array, access specific elements, replace one, and display the total count using `.length`.

---

## 💡 Hints

- Remember: arrays start at **index 0** — the first element’s index is `0`, not `1`.  
- Use **backticks** (\`) and template literals to combine text and variables in one message.  
- Example:  
  ```js
  console.log(`My favorite language is ${languages[2]}.`);
  ```

---

## 🏆 Bonus

- Add a new element to your array using `.push()` and log the result.  
- Remove the last element using `.pop()` and log the array again.  
- Try creating a **nested array** (an array inside another array).

## ✅ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Created a custom array with at least four items  
- [ ] Accessed and logged specific elements by index  
- [ ] Updated one value in the array  
- [ ] Used `.length` to display total number of items  
- [ ] (Bonus) Practiced using `.push()` and `.pop()`
